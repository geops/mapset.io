This creates an empty input field at the subsequent input field index, where a new stop can be defined as described previously.\n\n  ![](/img/addstop.png)\n\n  **Edit:** Stops can be updated by redefining them using the input fields as described previously, either by typing in new text and selecting a station from the suggestions or by highlighting a field by clicking it first and then clicking on the map to adjust the coordinate.\n\n  Furthermore, the sequence of stops can be updated via drag and drop.
